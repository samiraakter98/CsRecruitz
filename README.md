# CsRecruitz
"csRecruitZ" is basically a job posting website targeted to the job seekers and employers in the CS field. We took inspiration from the existing website "bdjobs.com" and tried to develop it keeping in mind how job-searching, showcasing CS-related works and achievements, applying, and shortlisting can be easier for a jobseeker and at the same time, job advertising and screening the applicants can be easier for the employer.
